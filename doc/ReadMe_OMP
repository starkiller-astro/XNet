XNet OMP NOTES 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experience tells us that the most efficient way to use OpenMP with XNet is to 
loop over the zones, assigning each network call to successive threads.  Thus 
most of the OMP is in the standalone driver, net.f, or in the interface 
between XNet and the hydrodynamic code to which it is coupled. 

However, to work properly (ie be calculated by zone) in the threads, variable 
which are a function of zone must be allocated or initialized in a parallel region 
and scoped as OMP Threadprivate.

There is, however, thread scoping in many modules in full_net.f, data.f, 
flux.f and esonom90.f common.f.  In addition, there are 2 variables to thread 
variables, mythread is the thread ID determined by the number of the threads, 
nthread is the number of threads.  These are distinct from the task identifiers 
myid and nproc, which identify processors or MPI_tasks.
