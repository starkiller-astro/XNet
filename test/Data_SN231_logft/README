This set of reaction data (Data_SN231_logft) contains the weak interaction rates tabulated as logft values.
Details about the format and most of the values can be found here:
K. Langanke & G. Martinez-Pinedo, Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables, Volume 79, Issue 1, p. 1-46. (2001)

The logft(T,ne) values are stored in the netweak file. While regular ffn rates are indicated by the "ecr" discriptor, the logft 
values have a "ft+" and "ft-" indicator in the heading line of each reaction. In principle it should be possible to mix and match both types of 
entries, but make sure you don't have both for the same reaction. The number of entries is diffrent for the logft rates, therefore it is 
important for the code to know which kind of rate is coming.

How to use logft rates in the standalone XNet:
To activate the logft rates, you set iweak=2 (or -2 for weak rates only) in the control file. 
Electron screening needs to be activated and the EOS needs to be setup to return the electron chemical potential.
