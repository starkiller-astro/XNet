Welcome to XNet 
======

XNet is a thermonuclear reaction network for astrophysical applications,
using a variety of temporal integration techniques. It is written in portable modern Fortran and makes use of a variety of matrix solving packages to obtain excellent speed (as much as 50% of peak) on as many platforms as possible.

The version contained in the repository is targeted at standalone
execution (post-processing nucleosynthesis). However, with the appropriate
interfaces, XNet has been used in a variety of large scale simulation
packages, including FLASH, CHIMERA and several other codes.

Before you dig deep into the source code, we suggest you learn the
basics of how thermonuclear reaction networks function, from one of the following sources.
