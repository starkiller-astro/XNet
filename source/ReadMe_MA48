Using the HSL (formerly Harwell Subroutine Library) sparse solver MA48
----------------------------------------------------------------------

jacobian_MA48.f90    Contains the sparse Jacobian build and solves with MA48 
                     package from the HSL Mathematical Software Library

                     MA48 is thread-safe and represents a significant
                     improvement in performance over the obsolete MA28 routine.

                     MA48 is proprietary software from Harwell, but a free 
                     academic license can be obtained from 
                     http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/archive/academic.html
                     If you use the MA48 code, register at the HSL archive.  
                     Registration is free with a *.edu e-mail address, and 
                     makes your use of the code legal.

                     Download both the Package and HSL dependencies and put 
                     them in a single file called MA48.f.
